# FlexboxDetective

FlexboxDetective is a small Javascript snippet for detecting flexbox support in the browser.

It appends the `flexbox` class to the html element if `display: flex;` is supported and `flex-wrap` class if the flex-wrap property is supported.

Flexbox support with -webkit- prefix is also detected.
